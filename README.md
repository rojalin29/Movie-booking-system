# Online Movie Ticket Booking System 

# Project Overview

The Online Movie Ticket Booking System is a web-based application that allows users to book movie tickets conveniently. The system provides a user-friendly interface, where users can register, log in, browse available movies, view movie details, book tickets, make payments, and receive ticket confirmations. The project was developed using JSP (JavaServer Pages) and JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) for database connectivity.

# Features and Functionality

User Registration: Users can create an account by providing their name, email address, phone number, and password. The system stores this information in the database.

User Login: Registered users can log in to the system using their credentials, providing a secure access point to book tickets.

Display Movies: The system displays a list of currently running movies, allowing users to browse and select the movie they want to watch.

Movie Details: Users can view detailed information about a selected movie, including the description and trailer, helping them make informed decisions.

Booking Tickets: Users can select the desired movie, date, time, and seat type, and specify the number of tickets they want to book.

Payment: The system facilitates online payment for the selected tickets, where users can provide their card details, including card name, card number, expiry date, and CVV.

Confirm Ticket: Once the payment is successfully processed, users receive a confirmation page with their ticket details, confirming their booking.

# Database Description

The system utilizes a database with two main tables:

User Registration Table: Stores user information, including user ID, password, name, email, and phone number.

User Login Table: Stores user credentials, including user ID and password, which are used for authentication during the login process.

# Conclusion

The Online Movie Ticket Booking System project aimed to provide users with a convenient and user-friendly platform to book movie tickets online. By utilizing JSP and JDBC, the project successfully implemented key features such as user registration, login, movie display, ticket booking, payment processing, and ticket confirmation. The system enhances the overall movie ticket booking experience, allowing users to access the system anytime, anywhere, and book tickets seamlessly. Through this project, I gained practical experience in web development, database connectivity and creating an intuitive user interface.
